# F22_OperSys
Operating systems are the core part of a computing device and computing devices are an integral part of our life, not only as programmers but also just as a human being â€“ it is enough to think about smart homes infrastructures, now available at accessible prices to everyone, at car devices, like smart navigator and cruise control systems, at other infrastructures. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of the structure of operating systems has a paramount role in the curriculum of a student in computer science and engineering. The purpose of this course is to provide such an understanding. This is a core course, so it is not among its goals to explore the details of the various proposal for operating systems that are now emerging: this is the subject of more advanced endeavors.
