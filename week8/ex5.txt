The physical address simply refers to the location of the data stored
on the actual RAM chip. At a certain address, we can access some data
on the physical chip. The virtual address can be used to obtain a
physical address with a virtual page table address using the MMU
(Memory Management Unit). Map virtual addresses to physical memory
addresses. When software accesses a region of the address space that
is not in physical memory, the device obtains it from virtual memory.
